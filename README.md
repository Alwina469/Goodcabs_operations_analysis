- Repeat vs New Passenger Ratio

- City-Wise Performance

- Growth Targets vs Actuals


### Project involves:

- **Exploratory data analysis**  using Python

- **Ad-hoc Reporting** using MySQL queries

- **Business Intelligence Dashboard** using Power BI

- **The data is stored across two databases: trips_db and target_db.**

## SKILLS AND TOOLS USED

- **SQL (MySQL):** For data cleaning, ad-hoc reporting, and answering business queries.

- **Python (Pandas,Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn):** For exploratory data analysis and visual insights.

- **Power BI:** For designing an interactive and self-explanatory dashboard for executive-level decision-making.

- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Techniques to uncover insights and trends across various performance metrics.

## KEY INSIGHTS

- **Jaipur:** Contributes the highest to Trips (18%) and Revenue (₹37.2M, 34%) but relies heavily on New Passengers (80%).

- **Lucknow:**  Ranks second in Trips (15%) but has low Revenue due to poor Ratings and lower Average Fare Per Trip.

- **Mysore:** Small contributor (4% of Trips) but exceeds Trip Targets by 20%, demonstrating high efficiency and satisfaction (Ratings above 8.0).

- **Surat:** Leads in Repeat Passenger Rate (42%) but struggles with Low Ratings due to lower fares.
